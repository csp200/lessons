## Course Overview

- Hands-on introduction to practical tools, platforms, and workflows commonly
  used in both classroom and industry

  - Typically shoehorned into unrelated courses

- Goals:

  - Reduce burden on other courses
  - Dedicate sufficient time to focus on and use them
  - Curate resources for self-study

---

- Command line interfaces (CLIs)
- Text manipulation
- Scripting and automation
- Development tools and processes
- Software configuration management (SCM)
- Containers and VMs
- Information security
- Web and Cloud tools
- AI tools / LLMs

---

### Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)

- A text-based interface for interacting with the computer â€” the OG UI!
- Allows users to efficiently execute commands, automate tasks, and manage files
- Significant in system administration, development, and troubleshooting

---

#### CLI Tools

- `bash`: Popular shell for Unix/Linux systems
- `PowerShell`: Command-line interface for Windows systems
- `zsh`, `fish`, etc.: Popular alternative shells
- `tmux`, `zellij`: *screen multiplexing* tools

---

### Text Manipulation

- Modifying, analyzing, and extracting information from text files
- Crucial for processing logs, data files, and configuration files

---

#### Text Manipulation Tools

- `grep`: pattern search
- `sed`/`awk`: stream editors
- `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, etc.: filtering and organizing text
- `ag`, `fd`, `zf`: advanced search tools
- `helix`: powerful, modal text editor

---

### Scripting and Automation

- Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows
- Enhances productivity and reduces human error

---

#### Scription and Automation Tools

- `bash`/`bashdb`: scripting language and tools
- `make`, `ant`: command line build tools
- `Python`: general-purpose scripting and automation language
- `cron`: task scheduler for Unix/Linux systems

---

### Development

- Tools and practices that streamline software development and collaboration
- Essential for version control, debugging, and team workflows

---

#### Development Tools

- `gdb`, `objdump`, `valgrind`, `strace`: debuggers / tracers
- REPLs: interactive coding and evaluation environment
- VSCode: integrated development environment
- Jupyter Notebooks: browser based coding environment

---

### Software Configuration Management (SCM)

- Managing changes in software to maintain integrity and traceability
- Automates the deployment and configuration of systems

---

#### SCM Tools

- Git: distributed version control system
- Apt: advanced packaging tool for managing Linux packages
- Ansible: Python-based tool for automates provisioning, deployment, and other
  software processes
- Kubernetes (k8s): automates processes such as deploying, scaling, and managing
  applications in containers

---

### Containers and VMs

- Running multiple operating systems or applications on a single machine.
- Improves resource utilization and simplifies testing/deployment.

---

#### Container and VM Tools

- Docker: container platform for virtual machines or applications
- VirtualBox: cross-platform virtualization software
- AWS EC2: cloud-based virtual machines

---

### Information Security

- Protecting systems and data from unauthorized access, threats, and
  vulnerabilities.
- Critical in safeguarding sensitive information.

---

#### Information Security Tools

- SSH: Secure remote access to servers
- shaXXXsum: secure hashing functions
- OpenSSL: Cryptography and security protocols
- Wireshark: Network protocol analyzer

---

### Web and Cloud

- Tools for developing, deploying, and managing applications on the web and in
  the cloud
- Essential for scalable and distributed systems

---

#### Web and Cloud Tools

- `ncat`, `curl`, `telnet`: command-line networking tools
- `rsync`: remote file synchronization tool
- AWS: Cloud computing platform.
- RESTful APIs

---

### AI

- Tools that leverage artificial intelligence to enhance productivity and
  decision-making.
- Transformative for automation, data analysis, and software development.

---

#### AI Tools

## Administrivia

---

### Grade Breakdown

- In-class Surveys: 20%
- Quizzes: 30%
- Machine Problems (MPs): 50%

---

#### In-Class Surveys

- Most lectures will include live, in-class surveys to help assess progress
  - 100% for participating
- First two missed surveys are dropped, 0 for each missed survey thereafter
- Surveys are all equally weighted

---

#### Quizzes

- Objective questions focused mostly on concepts and high-level technical
  knowledge
- Help you assess your own understanding
- You may take them an unlimited number of times before due date
- Highest score earned is counted
- ~8 quizzes total; weighted equally

---

#### Machine Problems (MPs)

- Practical/Coding assignments
- We provide high-level specifications & functional requirements

---

### Late Policy

- No assessments { Surveys, Quizzes, MPs } will be accepted late, for credit
- Make sure you know how to submit work before due date!
  - Failed submission is not a valid excuse for late submissions
- Contact me directly if there are extenuating circumstances, and I will
  consider on a case-by-case basis
