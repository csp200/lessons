# Course Topics Recap

- Remote workflows
- Text Wrangling
- Data serialization
- Command Line & Shell Scripting
- System Internals
- Git and Version Control
- Configuration and Automation Tools
- Containers and Virtualization
- Security and Safe Computing

---

# Remote workflows

- SSH (with public keys)
- Remote machine access and setup
- Terminal multiplexer (e.g., tmux) for convenience

---

# Text Wrangling & Data Processing

- `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, etc.
- Composing commands with pipes
- Text-focused editing (e.g., with `helix`)

---

# Data serialization

- Structure data representation: `JSON`, `yaml`, and others
- Useful for configuration files, documentation, data transmission
- Validation and querying tools: `jq`, `yq`

---

# Command Line & Shell Scripting

- Terminal usage (`bash`)
- Shell customization and dotfiles
- Writing shell scripts
- Automating common tasks

---

# System Internals

- Processes as running programs
- Process lifecycle (Reading, Running, Blocked, Terminated)
- System monitoring (`ps`, `top`, `htop`)
- Job management (`&`, `bg`, `fg`, `kill`)

---

# Git and Version Control

- Git basics: init, add, commit, log
- Viewing differences and history
- Branches, merging, conflict resolution
- Collaborative Git: GitHub, PRs

---

# Configuration & Automation

- Ansible basics
- System provisioning
- Infrastructure as code
- Build automation with `make`

---

# Containers & Virtualization

- Docker images and containers
- Writing Dockerfiles
- Networking and volumes
- Creating/Connecting multiple containers with `compose`
- Use cases: sandboxing, reproducibility

---

# Security and Best Practices

- File permissions
- Public key encryption (e.g., `GPG`)
- Working securely on "open" networks
  - Pubkey encryption with `SSH` vs. clear-text passwords
- Safe defaults and threat awareness

---

# What did we leave out?

- Web/Cloud APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs)
- AI Tools and Assistants

---

# How to Review and Practice

- Rerun and extend past assignments
- Build your own CLI or automation tools
- Start a GitHub project with friends
- Teach someone else what you learned

---

# Suggested Topics to Explore

- Nix/NixOS
- Kubernetes and DevOps Pipelines
- Advanced System Internals (a la CS 351/450)
- Advanced Networking (CS 455)
- Security and Ethical Hacking (CS 458)

---

# Suggested Topics (continued)

- Advanced Git Workflows
- Python or Rust Scripting
- AI-assisted Development
- **Contributing to Open Source**
  - Real-world collaboration
  - Learn by reading and doing
  - Public portfolio and impact

---

# The Next Decade of Tools

- Declarative and reproducible systems
- AI-augmented workflows
- DevSecOps and automation by default
- Cloud-native development
- Focus on composability and UX

---

# Final Advice

- **Be Curious**: Always ask how and why
- **Be Consistent**: Build daily habits with tools
- **Be Skeptical**: Understand what's under the hood
- **Stay Connected**: Communities, projects, blogs
- **Be a Toolmaker**: Build the tools you need

# Closing Thoughts

- Thank you!
- You now have the *language* to keep learning
- Keep exploring, building, breaking, fixing
- Practical computing tools are *force multipliers*!
