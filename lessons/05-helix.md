# Text Editing (Helix)

## Agenda

- The Helix text editor
- The Markdown language

## Overview

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is an example of a _modal_ text editor.
Unlike most text editors or word processors, for which there is typically only a
single mode of operation (i.e., inserting/editing text), in Helix the current
_mode of operation_ determines what your keystrokes do. When in _insert mode_
keys are used to insert text, but in other modes key strokes perform different
operations and commands. By dynamically switching between modes, the keyboard
can be used to efficiently insert text and perform all manner of text
manipulation, navigation, search, etc., functions.

Because much of your time as a programmer will be spent editing text, doing so
efficiently can save you a ton of time in the long run! Helix will be our
"official" text editor for the class this semester. Invest some time into
learning it, and I think you'll be impressed.

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is an example of a text
[markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) (other well
known ones include HTML, XML, and LaTeX), which lets us add formatting to plain
text documents. We will be making extensive use of it this semester -- all my
lesson files are in Markdown, and I will be asking you to write Markdown
documents as well.

Creating and editing Markdown documents is an excellent opportunity to practice
using the Helix editor, which is why we're presenting the two topics together!

## Reading / Tutorials

1. To access the Helix editor tutorial, run the command `hx --tutor`. You should
   be able to get through the entire tutorial in a few sessions spread over a
   couple of days.

2. The ["Getting Started"](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
   section of the Markdown Guide provides a good overview of the language, and
   the [Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is handy when
   you're first starting out.
